(This is actually not day one yet. But for some weird reason 24 hours without sleep is not enough. Also, I need to try out how to get this authorea document to the page hosted by Github. Let's see.)

(Apparently the only simple solution is to link straight to the Authorea document, which, by the way, is also maintained at Github. At least this means that I don't have to type markup. But the Authorea editor feels like it's 1855, obviously. So much nonsense.)
