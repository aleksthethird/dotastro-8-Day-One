(This is actually not day one yet. But for some weird reason 24 hours without sleep is not enough. Also, I need to try out how to get this authorea document to the page hosted by Github. Let's see.)

(Apparently the only \textbf{simple} solution is to link straight to the Authorea document, which, by the way, is also maintained at Github. At least this means that I don't have to type markup. But the Authorea editor feels like it's 1855, obviously. So much nonsense.)
